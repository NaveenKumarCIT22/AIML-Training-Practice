      "MapReduce is a key component of Hadoop, a big data analytics framework, used for processing large datasets. The MapReduce job consists of two main parts: map and reduce tasks. Small data subsets are created from input data, which are processed by map tasks. After the shuffle and sort process, the intermediate data is provided to reduce tasks, which produce the final output. The MapReduce job is submitted to the Hadoop cluster by the client, which is managed by the resource manager and node managers, while the application master and tasks run in containers. The process is hidden behind a single 'submit()' call on a Job object. MapReduce supports various types of jobs and features including I/O formats, join operations, and pipelining. Additionally, Hadoop includes Spark framework, which supports GPU computing through CUDA programming and API.\n"
